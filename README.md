# Fizzbuzz

Starterkit for 'Fizzbuzz' NodeJS project with TS and tests

## Specs

- For any integer multiple of 3 return 'Fizz'
- For any integer multiple of 5 return 'Buzz'
- For any integer multiple of 3 and 5 return 'FizzBuzz'

- Any other integer returns it as a string

Implement a method or function that takes an int and returns the correct string.

Even if these are fairly simple requirements, special attention should be given to readability, architectural principles and good practices
